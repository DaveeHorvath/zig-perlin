# Perlin Noise Generator and Visualiser
- a really quick project to get started with Zig, so dont judge too hard
- It creates an NxN square with each value representing perlin noise at those x,y coordinates
- it moves at a constant pace following y = (-1/2)*x line
# Usage
- clone the repo and then just run with
```
zig run main.zig
```
- get zig from: https://ziglang.org/
